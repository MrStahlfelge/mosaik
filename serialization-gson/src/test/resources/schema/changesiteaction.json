The current {@link org.ergoplatform.mosaik.model.ui.RootView}'s content is replaced by the new element by a difference analysis, thus resulting in scrollbars and element focus remaining. If the new element's id is present in the current view, only that element is replaced. Thus it is possible to change only very few elements of the tree.",
